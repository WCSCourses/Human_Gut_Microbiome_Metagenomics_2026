### Summary

The microbiome plays a critical role in shaping early-life health, influencing immunity, nutrition, and resistance to infection. Advances in metagenomic sequencing have revealed new insights into maternal and infant microbial communities, yet capacity to generate, analyse, and interpret such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

This intensive training course is a collaboration between Wellcome Connecting Science, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust, and will provide early career researchers and scientists with cutting-edge skills in microbiome study design, sequencing, bioinformatics data analysis, and data interpretation.

The course uses a blended learning model over three months, including pre-course modules, a 6-day residential workshop at KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya (12–17 April 2026), and post-course mentoring and networking activities.

The residential workshop will combine lectures, hands-on sessions, seminars, and discussions, progressing from fundamentals of microbiome metagenomics to applied data analysis and interpretation and professional development.

### Target Audience

This course is open to applicants based in Africa only, who are actively engaged in, or soon to commence related research or work, such as early to mid-career scientists, PhD students, and postdoctoral researchers working in microbiome and maternal/child health research.

### Learning outcomes

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Critically evaluate foundational concepts in microbiome metagenomics and bioinformatics in-relation to shaping early-life health, influencing immunity, nutrition, and resistance to infection.
- Apply practical skills to generate, analyse, and interpret microbiome metagenomics data using accessible tools and workflows.
- Assess and integrate ethical, equitable, and context-specific considerations into microbiome metagenomics  research.
- Analyse the potential and limitations of microbiome metagenomics technologies to advance health and scientific discovery.
- Strengthen professional skills in grant writing and public engagement.

### Programme

This course will cover experimental design and sampling methods, hands-on bioinformatics data analysis with appropriate statistical approaches, data interpretation and reporting. Participants will also explore ethical considerations of data-sharing practices, including consent, governance, and country-specific restrictions, while learning on data standards and public repository submissions. Collaborative learning will be emphasised through group projects, peer mentoring, and community-building activities, complemented by sessions on public engagement and effective communication of microbiome science to wider audiences.

The residential course will start at approximately 12:00 on Sunday 12 April 2026 and close at approximately 17:00 on Friday 17 April 2026. All times are in Nairobi Time (GMT+3).

The in-person course programme includes lectures, hands-on training, seminars, and discussions, to cover a range of  topics, from microbiome metagenomics fundamentals to applied analysis and professional development.

The topics covered are:

- Experimental design and sampling methods.
- Practical bioinformatics data analysis and relevant statistical methods using open-source tools.
- Data interpretation and reporting, to develop higher-level skills such as hypothesis generation and critical evaluation.
- Ethics and data sharing, including consent, sample handling, governance, and country-specific restrictions.
- Collaborative learning such group projects, peer mentoring, and community-building activities.
- Guidance on data standards and submission to repositories such as ENA, GSC, and SRA.
- Public engagement, with discussions on strategies for communicating microbiome science with wider audiences.
